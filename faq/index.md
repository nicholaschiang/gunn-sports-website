# Frequently Asked Questions
### Q: How does my child join the cross country or track team?
A: Students wishing to join the cross country team must complete the Athletic Registration and turn in a $200 athletic donation (checks payable to Gunn High School).

### Q: How often does the team practice?
A: The track team holds practice every day 20 minutes after school ends; On Saturdays (TBD) where there are not meets there will be optional, BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Saturday morning workouts.

### Q: What do we do at practice?
A: We start practice 20 minutes after the last academic bell.Monday is important for weekly announcements and rule reminders.

### Q: How are cross country meets scored?
A: To determine a team score, you add up the places for your first 5 finishers. The team with the lowest score wins. Athletes on incomplete teams (fewer than 5 finishers) do not count in the scoring, thus an athlete's place used for scoring can be lower than their actual finish place. In races where you are allowed more than 7 runners per team, only the top 7 finishers count towards scoring. In case of a tie, the 6th finisher for each team breaks the tie.

### Q: What if an athlete cannot compete during a meet (due to injury, illness, etc.)?
A: All team members are expected to attend all meets whether competing or not. Those not competing due to injury or minor illness will help with timing and at the finish line.  Athletes who qualify for weekend invitationals are expected to compete in those meets. Conflicts should be discussed with the event coach at least two weeks before the event. An athlete missing too many meets will not receive credit for the activity.
