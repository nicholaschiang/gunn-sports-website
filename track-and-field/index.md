## Help Wanted
If you enjoyed helping in the past or wish you had had a chance, itâ€™s not too late!!!  We need 8 parents (or more) to help us out at the League Meet. All schools are assigned jobs. Specifically we need help at the finish line and with the girls long jump and triple jump.  We would like to let Coach Jordan actually coach instead of running those events.  Please let me know if you can help us out.
