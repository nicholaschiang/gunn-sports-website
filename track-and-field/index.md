## Help Wanted
If you enjoyed helping in the past or wish you had had a chance, it’s not too late!!!  We need 8 parents (or more) to help us out at the League Meet. All schools are assigned jobs. Specifically we need help at the finish line and with the girls long jump and triple jump.  We would like to let Coach Jordan actually coach instead of running those events.  Please let me know if you can help us out.

### Athletic Registration
All athletes must complete an online Athletic Registration Registration is available online here. If an athlete has already participated in a sport at Gunn this school year, then the athlete does not need to complete another registration.

### Sports Fee
We recommend a $200 athletic donation (payable to Gunn High School). This fee covers the expenses for transportation, meet entry fees, and other items in the athletic department budget.

## Practice
We practice after school every day 20 minutes after the last bell, Monday through Friday.  All practices are mandatory.   Any non-illness absences (medical appointments, tutoring sessions, etc.) should be cleared in advance, preferably in writing.  If an athlete has to miss practice for a non-illness related reason, he or she is expected to complete the workout on their own either during their prep period or in the evening.  For freshmen and sophomores, unexcused absences are counted as a "cut" for their PE class.  Repeated unexcused absences will lead to dismissal from the team.

Practices on school holidays during the week are "recommended" and "highly recommended" for the varsity level athletes.  Saturday practices are optional, but "highly recommended" for the varsity level athletes (or those aspiring to be).

## Meets
All league meets are mandatory. As with practice, all non-illness absences must be cleared in advance. This is a team and not a conditioning class.

### Uniforms and Gear
When competing, athletes must wear school issued uniforms. Additional garments (spandex shorts or tights, short or long or long sleeve tops, athletic bras) must be a solid color and worn beneath the uniform. All relay team members’ uniforms must be identical. Jewelry is not allowed (earrings, rings, necklaces, bracelets, etc.). Sport watches and prescription eyeglasses are considered equipment and are acceptable. Medical alert tags and religious items may be worn, but must be taped to the body.

**Shoes:** Athletes are required to provide their own training and racing shoes.  It is extremely important that an athlete get a pair from a qualified running store to make sure that they get a shoe that fits properly, is designed for his or her type of foot, and is event appropriate.  Otherwise, you are likely to get injured.  Most stores give discounts to high school athletes. We have several great stores in our area (A Runner's Mind, in down town Los Altos; Fleet Feet on Santa Cruz Ave in Menlo Park; Zombie Runner on Cal Ave; Nike Store at Stanford Shopping Center).  Sprinters/jumpers/hurdlers must also have spikes and racing shoes/spikes are highly recommended for distance runners.  Throwers should talk to your coach about proper footware.

### Qualifying for Varsity
To earn a varsity letter, an athlete must satisfy at least one of the following:
- Compete varsity at the league champ meet or any post-season meet
- Score at least 5 points in league dual meets
- Compete in two invitationals
- Be a senior who has been on the team for at least 3 years
