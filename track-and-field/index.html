	<h3>Help Wanted</h3>
	<p>If you enjoyed helping in the past or wish you had had a chance, itâ€™s not
		too late!!!  We need 8 parents (or more) to help us out at the League Meet.
		All schools are assigned jobs. Specifically we need help at the finish line
		 and with the girls long jump and triple jump.  We would like to let Coach
		 Jordan actually coach instead of running those events.  Please let me know
		 if you can help us out. </p>
